# A station name aliases preset is a mapping from station names as they appear
# in an archive to lists of aliases for them that appear in recording and clip
# file names. The archive station names should be capitalized exactly they are
# in the archive. The capitalization of aliases is irrelevant since they and
# station names that appear in file names are converted to lower case before
# comparison.
